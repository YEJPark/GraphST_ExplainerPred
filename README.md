# GraphST_ExplainerPred

**GraphST_ExplainerPred** is a toolkit for predicting and explaining important features in spatial transcriptomics data using graph-based learning. This repository utilizes Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and GNNExplainer to identify critical genes and subcellular localizations for different cells, providing insight into cancer and other cellular states.

## Features

- **Graph-based Prediction**: Uses GAT for cell-level predictions based on spatial transcriptomics data.
- **Explainability**: Integrates GNNExplainer to evaluate feature importance, identifying key genes and their localizations.
- **Subcellular Resolution**: Processes data at the subcellular level for detailed insights.
- **Customizable Input**: Compatible with TSV files containing node and edge data.
